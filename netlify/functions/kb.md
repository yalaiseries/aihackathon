# AI (Hackathon) Collaboration 2026

## Objectives
- Upskill local and international young Architects, practitioners and firms in using AI and digital technologies to develop practical data-driven solutions that enhance creativity and productivity.
- Foster knowledge-sharing, innovation and collaboration within the Architecture and Built Environment community through ground-up initiatives.

## Target Outcomes
- Enable participants to collaboratively learn, develop, and share AI-assisted approaches and applications, creating practical and innovative solutions together with the community of practice (CoPr).
- This approach fosters collective initiatives and promotes scalable, collaborative outcomes, enabling participants to learn and build simultaneously.
- All online sessions will be recorded and shared within the CoPr, serving as resources for learning, exploring, and deploying AI-assisted applications. ArchiFest 2026 will showcase top entries.
